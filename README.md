# Un_Data_searcher_with_Java
This is the final Project of my Introduction to Java class at the AGH UST. In this project, the user can search for any country and get the flag information about the country. The results are shown on a simple GUI. Also, the search bar is in this GUI. In this project, Java programing language has been used.
